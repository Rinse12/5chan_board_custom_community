- posts are the equivalent plebbit-js term for "board" in 5chan
- Subplebbits are equivalent to community, which are essentially the same as boards in 5chan
- Every new feature or bug fix must include a test case that reproduces/covers it
- Never use `any` — always use proper types
- After modifying any file under `src/`, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify the build has no type errors
- After modifying types in `src/types.ts`, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to ensure all dependents still compile
